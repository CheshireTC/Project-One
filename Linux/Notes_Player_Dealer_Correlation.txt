After concluding my investigation of the Lucky Duck scam I have found that the dealer Billy Jones and the player Mylie Schmidt have been colluding to rig games at the Roulette Table. I began coming
to this conclusion by fist finding the player who was at the table everytime Lucky Duck took a loss. Mylie Shmidt was at the table all 13 times that there was a loss on the days of 3/10, 3/12, and 3/15.
After finding this information I looked into the dealers to see if there was any employee who was also at the table the same times Mylie was. It turned up that during those same 13 times Lucky Duck took
a loss the dealer for the roulette table was Billy Jones. In conclusion Billy Jones and Mylie Schmidt are the culprits of the scam.
